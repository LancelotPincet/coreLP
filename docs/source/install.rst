Installation
============

In this section, we will see how **coreLP** can be installed in your Python projects. We will first do a quick reminder on CLI basics necessary to install comfortably the library. Then, we will explain how to create a fresh project compatible with it using *uv*. Finally, we will show how to contribute to the source code development by cloning the repository with *git*.

1. CLI reminder
---------------

For installation, you will need to use a **C**ommand **L**ine **I**nterface (CLI) like your system terminal. If you are using Windows or macOS, you might not be familiar with these, so we will first do a quick reminder for these two OS. If you are using Linux, I suppose you will not need these and you can skip to the next part.

Opening the terminal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Windows
      First, you will need to open a terminal window: search for **"Windows PowerShell"** in the Start Menu (or press **Win + R**, type **PowerShell**, then press **Enter**)
      A terminal window will appear with something like: ``PS C:\Users\myusername> _``

   .. tab:: macOS
      First, you will need to open a terminal window: open **Applications → Utilities → Terminal** (or press **Cmd + Space**, type **Terminal**, and press **Enter**)
      A terminal window will appear with something like: ``MacBook:~ myusername$ _``

When the cursor (``_``) is blinking, it means you can type a command.  
The path you see on the left of the line is your **current directory**—the folder from which commands will be executed.

Commands generally follow this structure: ``command-name argument --option1 value --option2 value``
Options usually start with ``--option-name``, but one-letter shortcuts like `-y` for `--yes` may exist.
When a command is known by your system, you can type the beginning and press **Tab** to auto-complete it.
To learn more about available commands and their options, refer to online documentation (or ask your favorite AI assistant).

.. warning::

   For real noobs like me who come from Python courses, you might be used to Python editors ("IDE" = **I**ntegrated **D**evelopment **E**nvironment) with a shell. Therefore, you might think the PowerShell command lines accept Python commands, **which is wrong**.
   
   The Python editors shell launch under the hood a Python interpreter. You can identify if you are in a Python interpreter as the Python CLI starts with `>>> _`. To launch a Python interpreter in the terminal and get the same behavior as your Python editors, you need to have Python installed on your machine and write `python` to open the interpreter.

Navigation commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the OS terminal, `cd` (**C**hange **D**irectory) lets you move between folders.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Windows
      In Windows, folders are separated by ``\``
      ``cd`` command can be used various ways:
         - change directory using an absolute path: ``cd full\path\to\new\directory``
         - go to the parent folder: ``cd ..``
         - navigate to a folder inside your current directory: ``cd relative\path\inside\current\directory``
         - combine movements, for example to reach a folder inside the grandparent directory:  ``cd ..\..\relative\path\to\folder``
         - go to your user home directory: ``cd ~``

   .. tab:: macOS
      In macOS, folders are separated by ``/`` (like in Linux)
      ``cd`` command can be used various ways:
         - change directory using an absolute path: ``cd full/path/to/new/directory``
         - go to the parent folder: ``cd ..``
         - navigate to a folder inside your current directory: ``cd relative/path/inside/current/directory``
         - combine movements, for example to reach a folder inside the grandparent directory:  ``cd ../../relative/path/to/folder``
         - go to your user home directory: ``cd ~``
         - go back to previous directory (macOS only): ``cd -``

Folder management commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Windows
      - list folders and files in current **dir**ectory: ``dir``
      - **m**a**k**e a new **dir**ectory (=folder): ``mkdir MyFolderName``
      - **r**e**m**ove a **dir**ectory: ``rmdir MyFolderName``
      - **del**ete a file: ``del MyFile.txt``


   .. tab:: macOS
      - **l**i**s**t folders and files in current directory: ``ls``
      - **m**a**k**e a new **dir**ectory (=folder): ``mkdir MyFolderName``
      - **r**e**m**ove a directory (**r**ecursive delete): ``rm -r MyFolderName``
      - **r**e**m**ove a file: ``rm MyFile.txt``

2. Create project
-----------------

To create a project dependent on **coreLP** I highly recommand using `*uv* <https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/>`_ from *Astral* for installation and environment management as it is a very fast and all-in-one solution. However, if you are used to using *Anaconda*, we will also show how to initialize with this distribution at the end of this subsection.

Install *uv*
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To check if *uv* is installed, you can try the following command. If it gives you a version, than *uv* is already installed!

.. code-block:: shell

   uv --version

If it fails, you need to install *uv*.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Linux
      you can install with *curl*:
      .. code-block:: shell

         curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

      If *curl* did not seem to be installed, install it before following the command corresponding to your distro:
      - **Debian** and **Ubuntu**: ``sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl -y``
      - **Fedora**: ``sudo dnf install curl -y``
      - **Arch Linux** and **Manjaro**: ``sudo pacman -S curl``

   .. tab:: Windows
      I recommand using a package manager for the installation. You can use one the following:
      - `**WinGet <https://winstall.app/`_: ``winget install --id=astral-sh.uv  -e``
      - `**Scoop <https://scoop.sh/`_: ``scoop install main/uv``
      - `**Chocolatey <https://chocolatey.org/install`_: ``choco install uv``

      If you want to install *uv* using standalone installers or other methods, please refer to their `installation website <https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/`_

   .. tab:: macOS
      I recommand using a package manager for the installation. You can use one the following:
      - `**Homebrew <https://brew.sh/`_: ``brew install uv``
      - **curl**: Follow the same steps as for the Linux protocole.
      - `**MacPorts <https://www.macports.org/install.php`_: ``sudo port selfupdate && sudo port install uv``

      If you want to install *uv* using standalone installers or other methods, please refer to their `installation website <https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/`_

Now *uv* should be installed on your macOS machine!




























2. Create a project using uv
----------------------------

To create a project with a dependency on **coreLP**, just type in your console by filling ``PATH_TO_PROJECT_PARENT``:

.. code-block:: shell

   cd PATH_TO_PROJECT_PARENT
   uv init my_project
   cd my_project

Then just add your project dependency to **coreLP**:

.. code-block:: shell

   uv add coreLP
   uv sync

Now your virtual environment with **coreLP** should appear in your project folder as *.venv*. 
For more information on how to manage your projects with uv, please refer to their `project guide <https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/projects/>`_ and their `project reference page <https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/>`_.

3. Run your scripts with uv
---------------------------

Once your project is set, you can run any scripts from system terminal inside the project folder with **coreLP** dependency using a simple command:

.. code-block:: shell

   uv run my_script.py

For more information on script dependencies with uv, please refer to their `script guide <https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/>`_.

Some scripts may be provided with the library :doc:`(see Reference Guide) <scripts>`.
To use them, you can just download them from the `GitHub repository <https://github.com/LancelotPincet/coreLP/tree/main/src/corelp/scripts>`_.

4. Run your script from an editor
---------------------------------

In practice, python scripts are often launched from an editor. Here are the following protocoles for most commonly used editors.

Visual Studio Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The console in **Visual Studio Code** (or any wrapper editor like **Cursor**) is a system terminal, so if you installed *uv* as suggested, you can just use :

.. code-block:: shell

   uv run my_script.py

**Visual Studio Code** also proposes a *Python extension* to give the ability to run scripts via a button (IPython under the hood).
If you use this button, do not forget to activate the *.venv* environment created (it may activate automatically if you run from project path, but this is not very consistent).
To manually activate : ``Ctrl+Shift+P → Python: Select Interpreter`` and select ``./.venv/Scripts/python.exe``

Anaconda tools (Spyder and Jupyter)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are using *Anaconda*, you probably are coding via *Spyder* and *Jupyter*. By default, these use the *root environment* of Anaconda with lots of packages pre-included (but not *coreLP*!).

The **first option** is to manually launch a kernel with the *.venv* we created before on your *Anaconda Spyder/Jupyter*.

- Spyder: ``Preferences → Python Interpreter`` and select ``./.venv/Scripts/python.exe``
- Jupyter: ``ipykernel`` must be installed in *.venv* (``uv add jupyter ipykernel``), then ``Kernel → Change Kernel``
This first option can be tedious every day.

The **second option** is to install Spyder and Jupyter in the *.venv*.

.. code-block:: shell

   uv add jupyter ipykernel
   uv add spyder

Then you can call these in a terminal to open directly the softwares with the *.venv*
However installing *Spyder* with *uv* (= *pip* installation) can sometimes be difficult with dependencies.

Other editors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As other editors have not been tested, please refer to dedicated support to run scripts from virtual environments with these.

5. Get source code
------------------

If you want to use the source code locally to modify the library, you can `git clone` the `GitHub source code <https://github.com/LancelotPincet/coreLP>`_.

First you need to have `git <https://git-scm.com/downloads>`_ installed on your computer. 
Go to the local directory where you want to save the repository (change ``PATH_TO_REPO_PARENT``):

.. code-block:: shell

   cd PATH_TO_REPO_PARENT

Then clone the repository:

.. code-block:: shell

   git clone https://github.com/LancelotPincet/coreLP.git

Now the library source code should be present

If you want to contribute, you can do a pull-request in the GitHub repository.
