### Description

### Installation

**template_name** uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) from Astral for installation and environment management.
As it is simple and has an all-in-one solution, I highly recommend switching your project to uv if you do not use it yet.

#### 1. Install uv
For installation, I recommend using a package manager like `Winget` or `Scoop` on Windows, and `Homebrew` on Linux and macOS.

For using [Winget](https://winstall.app/apps/astral-sh.uv), write in powershell :
```powershell
winget install --id=astral-sh.uv  -e
```

For using [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/#/apps?q=uv), write in powershell :
```powershell
scoop install main/uv
```

For using Homebrew, write in bash :
```bash
brew install uv
```

If you still want to install uv using standalone installers or other methods, please refer to their [installation website](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

#### 2. Create a project using uv
To create a project with a dependency on **template_name**, just type in your console by filling ```PATH_TO_PROJECT``` :
```sh
cd PATH_TO_PROJECT
uv init my_project
cd my_project
```

Then just add your project dependency to **template_name** :
```sh
uv add template_name
uv sync
```

Now your virtual environment with **template_name** should appear in your project folder as *.venv*.
For more informations on how to manage your projects with uv, please refer to their [project guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/projects/) and their [project reference page](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/)

#### 3. Run your scripts with uv
Once your project is set, you can run any scripts inside the project folder with **template_name** dependency using simple command :
```sh
uv run my_script.py
```

For more information on scripts dependencies with uv, please refer to their [script guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/)
